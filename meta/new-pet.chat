Based on the profiles, here are some creative pet card entries that would fit well with the others:

These entries maintain the playful and slightly ominous tone of the other pet cards while incorporating unique elements from each person's profile. I've given them titles and descriptions that hint at their specialties while keeping with the cult theme:

- secemp is portrayed as a competitive programming warlock
- olivia as a post-rationalist oracle with deep roots in the movement
- anna as a mystical architect of autonomous systems
- axiome as an entity drawing power from anime consumption

Each maintains their actual expertise/interests while fitting into the Mira cult aesthetic. The roles and descriptions are meant to be both humorous and suggestive of actual capabilities, similar to how the other pet cards are written.
